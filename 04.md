# Sliding Window Refresher

### Fixed Sliding Window

A fixed Sliding window maintains a specific length as it slides across a data structure.

If a fixed window of length `k` traverses a data structure from start to finish, it's guaranteed to see every subcomponent of length `k` in the data structure.


### Dynamic Sliding window

A dynamic sliding window can be applied to problems that ask us to find the longest or shortest subcomponent that satisfies a given condition (for example: all numbers in the window must be greater than 10).

## Generic Template for a fixed sliding window

```js
let left = 0;
let right = 0;
let currentData = null;
let res = null;

while (right < n) {
    // collect data
    currentData = update(dataStructure[right]);
    
    // if the window has reached the expected fixed length, we slide the window (shrink + expand)
    if (right - left + 1 === k) {
        // process the collected data for a given fixed window
        res = process(currentData);
        
        // update collected data as we shrink the window
        currentData = update(dataStructure[left]);
        
        // shrink the window
        left++;
    }
    
    // expand the window
    right++;
}
```

    }
    
    // once the window is valid again, we process the collected data
    res = process(currentData);
    
    // expand the window
    right++;
}

# Binary Search Intro

Binary search algorithms provide an efficient way to locate a target value in a *sorted* data structure by repeatedly halving the search space until the target is found.
This repeated division of the search space means that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time.
