# Sliding Window Refresher

### Fixed Sliding Window

A fixed Sliding window maintains a specific length as it slides across a data structure.

If a fixed window of length `k` traverses a data structure from start to finish, it's guaranteed to see every subcomponent of length `k` in the data structure.


### Dynamic Sliding window

A dynamic sliding window can be applied to problems that ask us to find the longest or shortest subcomponent that satisfies a given condition (for example: all numbers in the window must be greater than 10).

---

## Generic Template for a fixed sliding window

```js
let left = 0;
let right = 0;
let currentData = null;
let res = null;

while (right < n) {
  // collect data
  currentData = update(dataStructure[right]);
  
  // if the window has reached the expected fixed length, we slide the window (shrink + expand)
  if (right - left + 1 === k) {
    // process the collected data for a given fixed window
    res = process(currentData);
    
    // update collected data as we shrink the window
    currentData = update(dataStructure[left]);
    
    // shrink the window
    left++;
  }
  
  // expand the window
  right++;
}
```

## Generic Template for a dynamic sliding window

```js
let left = 0;
let right = 0;
let currentData = null;
let res = null;

while (right < n) {
  // collect data
  currentData = update(dataStructure[right]);
  
  while (conditionIsViolated) {
    // update collected data as we shrink the window
    currentData = update(dataStructure[left]);
    
    // shrink the window until it is valid again
    left++;
  }
  
  // once the window is valid again, we process the collected data
  res = process(currentData);
  
  // expand the window
  right++;
}
```

# Binary Search Intro

Binary search algorithms provide an efficient way to search a *sorted*, or *quasi-sorted* data structure (more on this later) by repeatedly halving the search space until the desired target value is found.
This repeated division of the search space means that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time.

---

# Most Basic Example: Finding a Specific Number in a Sorted Array

This is the most basic use case.

```js {*}{maxHeight:'340px'}
function binarySearch(nums: number[], target: number): number {
  // 1. Define left and right pointer
  // In this case, they are first first and last index of the array
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  
  // 2. Specify looping condition
  // In this case, the loop will execute for every single element in the array
  while (left <= right) {
    // 3. Calculate midpoint
    // Note: using Math.floor() biases the search space to the left when the number of elements being searched is even.
    // Depending on the problem, you may want to bias to the right by rounding up
    let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

    // 4. See if we've located the target at midpoint
    if (nums[mid] === target) {
        return mid;
    // 5. If midpoint is still below the target, set left pointer to the middle + 1 to continue the search in the right half
    } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
    // 6. If midpoint is above the target, set right pointer to middle - 1 to continue the search in the left half
    } else {
        right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  
  // 7. If we get here, we have searched every element in the array and the target was not found
  return -1;
}
```

# Binary Search Variants

There are a number of variations of binary search depending on what we need to find. The two most common variations are **Lower Bound** and **Upper Bound**.

- **Lower Bound:**
  - Finds the first position in an array where a target value appears, or the first position where a value could be inserted without breaking the order.
  - More generally, it can refer to *the smallest index at which a given condition is satisfied*

- **Upper Bound:**
  - Finds the last position where a target value appears, or the last position a value could be inserted without breaking order.
  - More broadly, it can also refer to *the first index where a condition is no longer met, or the last index where it is met*,

---

# Basic Lower Bound Example

In this example, the function looks for the *first* occurence of a repeating target number in a sorted array of numbers.

```js
function lowerBound(nums: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

    if (nums[mid] > target) {
        right = mid - 1;
    } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
    } else {
        right = mid;
    }
  }

  return nums[left] === target ? left : -1;
}
```

---

# Basic Upper Bound Example

In this example, the function looks for the *last* occurence of a repeating target number in a sorted array of numbers.

```js
function upperBound(nums: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    const mid = left + Math.ceil((right - left) / 2);

    if (nums[mid] > target) {
        right = mid - 1;
    } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
    } else {
        left = mid;
    }
  }

  return nums[right] === target ? right : -1;
}
```

## First and Last Occurences

```js
/*
  Given the array:
    [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  
  When searching for the first and last occurences of target `2`:

  - lowerBound(array, 2) identifies the first index where a value equals target:
      [ 1, *2*,  2,  2,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8 ]
            ^
  
  - upperBound(array, 2) identifies the last index where a value equals a target:
      [ 1,  2,  2,  2,  *2*, 3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8 ]
                         ^

## Insertion Points

```js
/*
  Given the array:
    [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  
  When searching for an insertion point for an additional `2`:

  - lowerBound(array, 2) returns the first valid position where `2` can be inserted, which is at the first occurrence
      [ 1, *2*, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
            ^
  - upperBound(array, 2) returns the last valid position where `2` can be inserted without disrupting the order, which is at the first element greater than `2`:
      [ 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, *3*, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
                        ^
*/
```

# Monotonicity

As mentioned in the Intro slide, binary search doesn't strictly require a fully "sorted" array. What is essential though is **monotonicity**â€” the property that once a condition holds at some point, it continues to hold in a specific direction.

For reference, here again are two of our previous defintions of Lower and Upper Bound. **Broadly speaking:**
- **Lower Bound** identifies *the smallest index at which a given condition is satisfied*
- **Upper Bound** identifies *the first index where a condition is no longer met, or sometimes the last index where it is met*

**Note:** What precisely constitutes an "upper bound" or "lower bound" depends on the specific problem being solved. Based on my reading, there is not a strict consensus on what these concepts mean in all cases. We will proceed with some specific examples, but just know that the concepts are not strictly defined.

---

Consider the array:

```js
[1, 2, 4, 3, 0, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6]
```

- The array is not fully sorted.
- However, every element before index 5 is `< 5`.
- And every element from index 5 onward is `> 5`.

So, this array has some monotonicity, which means we can use binary search on it.

<p v-click class="opacity-100">

For example, a `lowerBound` search to find the first element where `value >= 5` yields:

```js
[1, 2, 4, 3, 0, *5*, 7, 9, 8, 6]
```

</p>

---

We can represent monotonic searches in a more generic way using boolean values T (true) and F (false).

```js
[1, 2, 4, 3, 0, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6]
```

Evaluating the condition (`value >= 5`) for each element in that array produces:

```js
[ F, F, F, F, F, T, T, T, T, T ]
```

<p v-click class="opacity-100">

The `lowerBound` operation finds the first T:

```js
[ F, F, F, F, F, *T*, T, T, T, T ]
```
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-100">

Now consider this array:

```js
[ T, T, T, T, T, F, F, F, F, F ]
```

The `upperBound` operation finds the first element where the condition is no longer `true`, the first F:

```js
[ T, T, T, T, T, *F*, F, F, F, F ]
```

</p>

# Key Things to Consider When Implementing Any Binary Search

<div class="h-80 overflow-auto">

It is difficult to come up with generic templates for binary searches that work for all problems. However, there are a consistent set of procedures that you must follow for every binary search problem:


1. How to determine the search space (what should the `left` and `right` pointers be)

2. What is the loop exit condition?
    - `left <= right`: `while` breaks when `left` and `right` cross each other
    - `left < right`: `while` breaks when `left` and `right` meet

3. What conditions should be used to decide whether to narrow the search space to the left or the right?

4. How to narrow the search space?
    - Towards the left
      - `right = mid - 1`
      - `right = mid` (if `mid` is a possible candidate for the correct answer)
    - Towards the right
      - `left = mid + 1`
      - `left = mid` (if `mid` is a possible candidate for the correct answer)

5. What needs to be returned?
    - Usually `left` or `right`, assuming the target value exists (`-1` if not)
    - Could also be `left - 1` or `right - 1` depending on what kind of upper/lower bound the problem requires
