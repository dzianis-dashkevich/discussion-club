# Stack

Stack is an abstract data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

The main operations are:

- Push (adds an element to the top of the stack): O(1)
- Pop (removes the top element of the stack and returns it): O(1)
- Peek (returns the top element of the stack without removing it): O(1)
- isEmpty (checks if the stack is empty): O(1)

# LIFO

Stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.
This unique property makes stacks a very useful data structure for solving problems where the order of processing or removal is critical.
Few examples of such problems are:
- Handling nested structures (parsing or validating), eg: validating nested parentheses
- Reverse order: you can use stack for reversing sequences
- Substituting recursion: Since recursion is a call stack itself you can use stack to substitute recursion
- Monotonic stacks: Special-purpose stacks maintain a monotonic property (increasing or decreasing) sorted order.

# Monotonically increasing stack

A Monotonically Increasing Stack is a stack where elements are placed in increasing order from the bottom to the top. 
Each new element added to the stack is greater than or equal to the one below it. 
If a new element is smaller, we remove elements from the top of the stack until we find one that is smaller or equal to the new element, or until the stack is empty. 
This ensures that the stack always stays in increasing order.

# Monotonically increasing stack generic template

```js
// Start with an empty stack.
const stack = [];
//Iterate through the elements of the input array.
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  //while stack is not empty AND top of stack is more than the current element
  while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] > arr[i]) {
    //pop element from the stack
    stack.pop();
  }
  //Push the current element onto the stack.
  stack.push(arr[i]);
}
// At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the monotonic increasing order of elements.
```

---

# Monotonically increasing stack example
```js
// Lets assume we have an array [3, 4, 1, 1, 5, 2]
// The stack will look like this:
// 3: [3] (stack is empty, so we just push)
// 4: [3, 4] (3 < 4, so we push 4)
// 1: [1] (4 > 1, so we pop 4, 3 > 1, so we pop 3, and push 1)
// 1: [1, 1] (1 === 1, so we push 1)
// 5: [1, 1, 5] (1 < 5, so we push 5)
// 2: [1, 1, 2] (5 > 2, so we pop 5 and push 2)
// as you can see we have a stack with elements in increasing order
```

# Monotonically decreasing stack

A Monotonically Decreasing Stack is a stack where elements are placed in decreasing order from the bottom to the top. 
Each new element added to the stack must be smaller than or equal to the one below it. 
If a new element is greater than top of stack then we remove elements from the top of the stack until we find one that is greater or equal to the new element, or until the stack is empty. 
This ensures that the stack always stays in decreasing order.

  stack.push(arr[i]);
}
// At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the monotonic decreasing order of elements.
