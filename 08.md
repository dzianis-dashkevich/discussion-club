# Prefix Sum Pattern

A prefix sum is an array where each element stores the sum of all preceding elements in the original array up to some index. This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray in constant time.

```ts

function computePrefixSum(nums: number[]): void {
    let prefix = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        prefix += nums[i];
        nums[i] = prefix;
    }
}

```

# Calculate sum of subarray

```ts
// nums is expected to be a prefix sum array
function subarraySum(nums: number[], left: number, right: number): number {
    if (left === 0) {
        return nums[right];
    }
    
    return nums[right] - nums[left - 1];
}

```

# Interval Pattern

An interval can be represented as a pair of numbers, where the first number is the start of the interval and the second number is the end of the interval.

- Closed Intervals: both start and end are included in the interval. \[1, 5\] includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Open Intervals: start and end are not included. (1, 5) includes 2, 3, 4.
- Half-Open Intervals: one of the endpoints is included, but not both. \[1, 5) includes 1, 2, 3, 4.

# Overlapping Intervals

Two intervals overlap if they share at least one common value.

Given interval A starts **before** interval B:

- if A.end < B.start, then A and B do not overlap
- if A.end >= B.start, then A and B overlap

To apply this conditions to any two intervals, we should find which interval starts first. (In many cases, we can sort the intervals by their start time.)

```ts
// A starts BEFORE B and A.end < B.start, so they do not overlap
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
//               B ------
//         
//  A ------   

// A starts BEFORE B and A.end >= B.start, so they overlap
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
//       B ------
//         
//  A ------
```
