# What is Graph?

A graph is a data structure composed of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to model relationships, where edges define the relationships.

Here is an implementation of the GraphNode class:

```ts
class GraphNode<T> {
    public readonly val: T;
    public readonly neighbors: Array<GraphNode<T>> = [];

    constructor(val: T) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

---

# Terminology

- Adjacent node (neighbor): Two nodes are adjacent if there is an _edge_ connecting them.
- Degree: the number of _edges_ connected to a node.
- Path: a sequence of _nodes_ connected by edges.

# Types

- Directed vs undirected: In a directed graph, edges have a direction associated with them.

- Weighted vs unweighted: In a weighted graph, edges have a weight associated with them (eg: distance or cost).

- Cyclic vs acyclic: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and end at the same node.

- Sparse vs dense: In a dense graph, number of relationships is large (typically square of the nodes).

# Representations

In some problems you might not be given the graph directly. In these situations, it is necessary to create your own representation of the graph.
The two most common are: adjacency list and adjacency matrix.

In an adjacency list the neighbors of each node are stored as a list. Can be implemented using hash map, where the key is the node and the value is the list of neighbors.

In an adjacency matrix the graph is represented as a 2D matrix where `matrix[i][j]` indicate an edge between nodes `i` and `j`.


---

# Pros/Cons adjacency list

Adjacency list are preferred when representing sparse graphs (less space) and when we need to iterate over all the neighbors of a node efficiently:
- pros:
  - Space efficient for sparse graphs (fewer edges).
  - Easy to iterate over neighbors of a node.
  - Faster to add/remove edges (especially in dynamic graphs).
- cons:
  - Checking if an edge exists between two nodes is slower: O(V) in worst case (if unsorted).

---

# Pros/Cons adjacency matrix

Adjacency matrices are preferred when representing dense graphs and frequent checks for edge are needed (O(1)):
- pros:
  - Edge existence check is O(1).
  - Useful for dense graphs (many edges).
- cons:
  - Consumes more space, even if many cells are 0 (sparse graphs).
  - Iterating over neighbors takes O(V).

# Traversals

Primary graph traversals are DFS (Depth-first-search) and BFS (Breadth-first-search). Similar how we travers trees, but it might be necessary to keep track of visited nodes.

The example is based on tree (which is a specific graph use-case) for better visualization.


---

# BFS

Since we process nodes by going layer by layer we use queue in BFS

```ts
// Runtime: O(V + E)
// Each node (V) is visited exactly once due to the visited set.
// For each node, you iterate over its neighbors — total across all nodes is E (all edges).
// Space: O(V)
// visited: stores up to V nodes → O(V)
// queue: in the worst case, holds up to V nodes (wide graphs)
function bfs<T>(node: GraphNode<T>, cb: (val: T) => void): void {
    const visited = new Set();
    const queue = new Queue([node]);
    
    while (!queue.isEmpty) {
        const node = queue.dequeue();
        
        if (!visited.has(node)) {
            visited.add(node);
            cb(node.val);
            for (let i = 0; i < node.neighbors.length; i++) {
                queue.enqueue(node.neighbors[i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# DFS (iterative)

Since we process nodes by going in depth, we use stack:

```ts
// Runtime: O(V + E)
// Each node (V) is visited exactly once due to the visited set.
// For each node, you iterate over its neighbors — total across all nodes is E (all edges).
// Space: O(V)
// visited: stores up to V nodes → O(V)
// stack: In the worst case (deepest path), the stack can be V deep → O(V)
function dfs<T>(node: GraphNode<T>, cb: (val: T) => void): void {
    const visited = new Set();
    const stack = new Stack([node]);

    while (!stack.isEmpty) {
        const node = stack.pop();

        if (!visited.has(node)) {
            visited.add(node);
            cb(node.val);
            for (let i = node.neighbors.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                stack.push(node.neighbors[i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

# DFS (recursive)

Since DFS uses stack we can rewrite more elegantly using recursion:

```ts
// Runtime: O(V + E)
// Each node (V) is visited exactly once due to the visited set.
// For each node, you iterate over its neighbors — total across all nodes is E (all edges).
// Space: O(V)
// visited: stores up to V nodes → O(V)
// Recursion stack: In the worst case (deepest path), the call stack can be V deep → O(V)
function dfs<T>(node: GraphNode<T>, cb: (val: T) => void, visited: Set<GraphNode> = new Set()): void {
    if (visited.has(node)) {
        return;
    }
    
    visited.add(node);
    cb(node.val);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < node.neighbors.length; i++) {
        dfs(node.neighbors[i], cb, visited);
    }
}
```

# Topological Sort

Topological Sort is an ordering of the vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u → v`, node `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

Key Points:
- It only applies to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
- It's not necessarily unique—there can be multiple valid topological orderings.


---

# Why Do We Need Topological Sort?

Topological sort helps solve problems involving dependency resolution. It answers: “In what order should I perform tasks so that prerequisites are met?”

Real-World Examples:
- Task scheduling: Some tasks must be done before others (e.g., in project management or build systems).
- Course prerequisites: In a university curriculum, some courses depend on completion of others.
- Package installation: Dependencies must be installed before the package.
- Makefiles/compilers: Build a program by compiling files in the right order.

---

# Kahn’s Algorithm

BFS-based approach to perform a topological sort.

- Calculate In-degrees: Count how many edges point to each node.
- Initialize Queue: Add all nodes with in-degree 0 (i.e., no prerequisites).
- Process Queue
  - Remove a node from the queue
  - Add it to the topological ordering
  - Decrease in-degree of all its neighbors by 1
  - If any neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue
- Check for Cycles: If the number of nodes in the topological order is less than total nodes, the graph has a cycle.

# Kahn's Algorithm implementation

```ts {*}{maxHeight:'390px'}
// let's assume that graph is a hash map Map<GraphNode, Array<GraphNode>>
// Runtime: O(V + E), v - nodes, e - edges:
// Each node is processed exactly once (O(V))
// Each edge is examined once when reducing the in-degree of its target node (O(E)).
// Space: O(V), The in-degree array: O(V) and The queue of nodes with 0 in-degree: O(V) in the worst case.
function topologicalSort(graph: Map<GraphNode, Array<GraphNode>>): Array<GraphNode> {
    const inDegree = new Map();
    const queue = new Queue<GraphNode>();
    const result = [];

    // Initialize in-degree of each node
    for (const node of graph.keys()) {
        if (!(node in inDegree)) {
            inDegree.set(node, 0);
        }

        for (const neighbor of node.neighbors) {
            if (inDegree.has(neighbor)) {
              inDegree.set(neighbor, inDegree.get(neighbor) + 1);
            } else {
              inDegree.set(neighbor, 1);
            }
        }
    }

    // Collect all nodes with in-degree 0
    for (const node in inDegree) {
        if (inDegree.get(node) === 0) {
            queue.enqueue(node);
        }
    }

    // Process nodes with in-degree 0
    while (!queue.isEmpty) {
        const current = queue.dequeue();
        result.push(current);

        for (const neighbor of graph.get(current).neighbors) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (inDegree.get(neighbor) === 0) {
                queue.enqueue(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    // If not all nodes are processed, there's a cycle
    if (result.length !== inDegree.size) {
        throw new Error("Graph has at least one cycle, topological sort not possible.");
    }

    return result;
}

# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a shortest-path algorithm. It finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph (with non-negative weights).

Steps:
- Initialize the distances to all nodes as Infinity, except the source node which is 0.
- Use a priority queue (min-heap or similar) to always pick the node with the smallest known distance.
- For each picked node:
  - Check all its neighbors.
  - If going through this node offers a shorter path to a neighbor, update the neighbor’s distance.
- Continue until all nodes are processed.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation

```ts {*}{maxHeight:'340px'}
// Input
// src: number (source node)
// v: number (number of nodes)
// edges: number[][] ([[startNode, endNode, weight]])
function dijkstra(v: number, edges: number[][], src: number): number[] {
  // Create adjacency list ({ node -> [[node, weight], [node, wight]...] })
  const adj = constructAdj(edges, v);

  // Create a min heap to store [distance, node]
  const minHeap = new MinHeap();

  // Create an array for distances and initialize all distances as infinity
  const dist = new Array(v).fill(Infinity);

  // Push the source node with distance 0
  minHeap.push([0, src]);
  dist[src] = 0;

  // Process the heap
  while (!minHeap.isEmpty) {
    const [distance, node] = minHeap.pop();

    // Traverse all neighbors of node
    for (const [neighbor, weight] of adj[node]) {
      if (dist[neighbor] > dist[node] + weight) {
        dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight;
        minHeap.push([dist[neighbor], neighbor]);
      }
    }
  }

  return dist;
} 
```
