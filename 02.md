# Refresher Example 1

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        console.log(i, j);
    }
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
This is a basic example of a matrix traversal.

Runtime Complexity is O(n*m) and Space Complexity is O(1)

Follow-up: what if n === m?
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Runtime Complexity is O(n^2) and Space Complexity is O(1)
</p>

# Refresher Example 2
```ts
for (let i = n; i >= 0; i /= 3) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
We divide by 3 in each iteration, so the number of iterations is log base 3 of n.

Runtime Complexity is O(log n) and Space Complexity is O(1)

Follow-up: why don't we use log base 3 in the answer asymptotic notation?
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
According to the log base change formula:

$log_x{N} = \frac{log_y{N}}{log_y{x}}$

${log_y{N}} = log_y{x} * log_x{N} = C * log_x{N}$

$log_y{x}$ is always a constant. So we can ignore log bases in asymptotic notation.
</p>

---

# Refresher Example 3
```ts
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j <= n; j *= 2) {
        console.log(i, j);
    }
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
The outer loops runs n times.

The inner loop runs
$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \frac{n}{i}$

log base 2 because j is multiplied by 2 in each iteration and $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$ because `j` depends on `i`.

Runtime Complexity is O(n*log n) and Space Complexity is O(1)
</p>

---

# Refresher Example 4
```ts
const number = 123456789; // could be any number of digits N

let digits = 0;

while (number > 0) { 
    number = Math.floor(number / 10);
    digits++;
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
This is a basic example of a number of digits counter. Since we divide by 10 in each iteration, the number of iterations is log base 10 of n.

Runtime Complexity is O(log n) and Space Complexity is O(1)

Follow-up: How can we rewrite this code without using a loop?
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:

We can rewrite using built-in `Math.floor(Math.log10(number)) + 1` method.
</p>

---

# Refresher Example 5
```ts
const arr1 = [1,2,3]; // N elements
const arr2 = [3,4,5,6]; // M elements

const set1 = new Set(arr1);
const set2 = new Set(arr2);

const result = Array.from(set1.intersection(set2));
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
This is a basic example of an intersection of two arrays.

We iterate through each element in arr1 when creating set1 and allocate memory for it.

Then we iterate through each element in arr2 when creating set2 and check if it exists in set1.

We also iterate through resulting intersection when creating result array.

Runtime Complexity is O(N + M) and Space Complexity is O(N + M)
</p>

---

# Refresher Example 6

```ts

const arr = []; // any sorted array of N elements
const target = 0; // any number

let left = 0;
let right = arr.length - 1;

while (left < right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
        right = mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
    } else {
        right = mid - 1;
    }
}

// lower bound is left or -1
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
This is a basic example of finding lower bound of a potentially repeated item using binary search. We use 2 pointers approach and cut the array in half in each iteration.
Runtime Complexity is O(log n) and Space Complexity is O(1)
</p>

---

# Refresher Example 7

We already covered this example in the previous session, but this is slightly different example ;)

```ts
function f(n) {
    if (n === 1) {
        return;
    }
    
    f(n / 2);
    f(n / 2);
    f(n / 2);
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Answer:
We recursively call function 3 time and divide n by 2 in each iteration.
The maximum call stack depth is log base 2 of n.
Since we call function 3 times, we will have 3 element on each level of the tree.
so the total number of calls is 

$3^{log_2{N}}$ , we can rewrite it as $N^{log_2{3}}$ :

$3^{\log_2{N}} = 3^{\frac{\log_3{N}}{\log_3{2}}} = 3^{\log_3{N} \cdot \log_2{3}} = (3^{\log_3{N}})^{\log_2{3}} = N^{\log_2 3}$

So runtime complexity is O($N^{log_2{3}}$) ~O($N^{1.5}$) which is less than O($N^{2}$) and higher that O(N) and Space Complexity is O(log n)

### Let's consider the following function

```js
function heavyWork(inoput) {
    let result = // do something heavy (eg: decrypt segment, transmux segment, etc...)
    
    return result;
}
```
<p v-click class="opacity-50">
How can we optimize this function?
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
We can use memoization!
</p>

---

### Memoization

```js
function memo(fn) {
    const cache = new Map();

    return function(...args) {
        const key = createKeyFromInput(args);

        if (cache.has(key)) {
            return cache.get(key);
        }

        const result = fn.apply(this, args);
        cache.set(key, result);

        return result;
    };
}

```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Can you think of any issues we could run into when using the function above?
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
The big problem is memory usage. Our application might call f with lots of different inputs and each result will be stored in the hashtable forever! Can you come up with some ideas to improve this?
</p>

---

### Bound size and use FIFO to evict cache

```js {*}{maxHeight:'300px'}
function memo(fn, cacheSize = 50) {
    const cache = new Map();
    const queue = new Queue(cacheSize);

    return function(...args) {
        const key = createKeyFromInput(args);

        if (cache.has(key)) {
            return cache.get(key);
        }

        const result = fn.apply(this, args);
        
        if (queue.isFull) {
            const keyToRemove = queue.dequeue();
            cache.delete(keyToRemove);
        }
        
        cache.set(key, result);
        queue.enqueue(key);

        return result;
    };
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Can you think of any cases where this approach would be inefficient?
</p>

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
In most cases we care about the usage of the item rather than the order they were added.

FIFO: Evicts items in the order they were added. The oldest item (the one that entered first) is removed first, regardless of how often or recently it was accessed.

LRU: Evicts the item that has not been used for the longest period of time. It tracks access history so that even if an item was added a long time ago, it wonâ€™t be evicted if it has been accessed recently.
</p>

---

### Use LRU cache

```js {*}{maxHeight:'400px'}
function memo(fn, cacheSize = 50) {
    const cache = new LRUCache(cacheSize);

    return function(...args) {
        const key = createKeyFromInput(args);

        if (cache.has(key)) {
            return cache.get(key);
        }

        const result = fn.apply(this, args);

        cache.set(key, result);

        return result;
    };
}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
Let's review the LRU cache implementation in the following slide.
</p>

---

### LRU cache implementation

```js {*}{maxHeight:'380px'}
class _Node {
    next: _Node | null = null;
    prev: _Node | null = null;
    val: number;
    key: number;

    constructor(val: number, key: number) {
        this.val = val;
        this.key = key;
    }
}

class LRUCache {
    private _capacity: number;
    private _map: Map<number, _Node>;
    private _head: _Node;
    private _tail: _Node;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this._capacity = capacity;
        this._map = new Map();
        this._head = new _Node(-1, -1);
        this._tail = new _Node(-1, -1);
        this._head.next = this._tail;
        this._tail.prev = this._head;
    }

    private _removeNode(node: _Node): void {
        node.prev.next = node.next;
        node.next.prev = node.prev;
    }

    private _insertToTail(node: _Node): void {
        const prev = this._tail.prev;
        prev.next = node;
        node.prev = prev;
        node.next = this._tail;
        this._tail.prev = node;
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (!this._map.has(key)) {
            return -1;
        }

        const node = this._map.get(key);
        this._removeNode(node);
        this._insertToTail(node);

        return node.val;
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (this._map.has(key)) {
            const node = this._map.get(key);
            node.val = value;
            this._removeNode(node);
            this._insertToTail(node);
            return;
        }

        if (this._map.size + 1 > this._capacity) {
            const node = this._head.next;
            this._removeNode(node);
            this._map.delete(node.key);
        }

        const node = new _Node(value, key);
        this._map.set(key, node);
        this._insertToTail(node);
    }

}
```

<p v-click class="opacity-50">
As you can see we use doubly linked list for LRU cache implementation.

We could use min-heap to get `logN` efficiency, but with doubly-linked list we can achieve `O(1)` efficiency.

# Linked Lists applications

I just demonstrated one of the applications of linked lists, but there are many more! Here are some examples:

- You can implement stacks and queues using linked lists with O(1). Linked lists can efficiently support stack and queue operations without the need for resizing or shifting elements (as in arrays).
- You can implement LRU and LFU caches to achieve O(1) efficiency.
- Linked lists are used in HashTable to handle collisions. Each bucket in the hash table can be a linked list that stores all the elements that hash to the same index.
- Operating systems and memory allocators use linked lists to keep track of free memory blocks. Each block is linked to the next free block.
- Operating systems, especially in embedded and real-time environments, use linked lists to manage processes, tasks, or interrupts in scheduling algorithms.

### Singly Linked List Implementation

```ts {*}{maxHeight:'400px'}
class ListNode<T> {
    public value?: T;
    public next: ListNode<T> | null = null;

    constructor(value?: T, next: ListNode<T> | null = null) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = next;
    }
}


class SinglyLinkedList<T> {
    // Trick: dummy node to simplify insertion/deletion at the head.

        this.tail = newNode;
        this._size++;

            if (toRemove === this.tail) {
                this.tail = prev;
            }
            this._size--;

            return toRemove.value;
        }

        return undefined;
    }
}


```

This implementation is a basic singly linked list with the following operations: prepend, append, insertAt, remove, removeAt.

# Two pointers technique

In all problems from the previous slide you used 2 pointers technique.

There are different variations of this technique:

- Fast and slow pointers
- Fixed sliding window
- Dynamic sliding window
- Inward moving pointers
- Staged pointers
- etc..
